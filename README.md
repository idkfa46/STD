# Translation file
Here below you can find a quick guide to support me in the software translation.

For each text line in the software you will find the following format in the translation file:

# T_("The software is already running")
# csCZ("Oprogramowanie już działa")
# esES("El software ya se está ejecutando")
# enUS("The software is already running")
# itIT("Il programma è già in esecuzione")

The 1st line with "T_" include the language actually in use (most of them are in Italian at the moment)

The 2nd line "csCZ" will include Polish translation

The 3rd line "esES" will include SPanish translation

The 4th line "enUS" will include English translation

The 5th line "itIT" will include Italian translation



Sometimes you will find text formatting tags that have not to be modified or the software layout will change. It's quite easy to identify them, here below a few examples:

T_("@@iml:1950*1200`carpenteria:dentedoppio`") - formatting tag: @@iml:1950*1200`

T_("[A2> Pag. $$P") - formatting tag: [A2> .... $$P

T_("τ[, d] < f[, v,d]") - formatting tag: [, ... ]


Please, just edit the translation file and add your translation for your language into brackets!

If need we can define a new language tag and add as many languages as we want.... At the end of the translation work the 1st line will be changed to english version as the main language and below we will have all possible tranlations.

thanks for your support.

Regards,
Matteo
